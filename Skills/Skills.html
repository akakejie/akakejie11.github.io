                <p>I was known as a <em>jack of all trades, master of none  </em>. <sup>1</sup> In other words, I could do many things, but I wasn’t 
                    particularly great at any of them. <sup>2</sup> Sometimes, I felt like I wasn’t good enough because I couldn’t master one specific skill. <sup>3</sup>
                    But growing up on the streets taught me a lot. <sup>4</sup> The challenges and experiences I faced shaped who I am today and helped me develop a 
                    wide range of skills. <sup>5</sup> Instead of feeling discouraged, I learned to embrace my versatility and use it to my advantage. <sup>6</sup>
            
                    One of the most important skills I learned was adaptability. <sup>7</sup> No matter what problems I faced, I found ways to adjust and overcome them. <sup>8</sup>
                    This ability helped me in many aspects of life, from school to social situations. <sup>9</sup>
                    
                    I was also known for being sporty and as a sporty kid, I made it a point to try every sport I could, learning new skills along the way. <sup>10</sup> 
                    In basketball, I became proficient in dribbling, shooting, and finishing. <sup>11</sup> I also learned volleyball skills like receiving, serving, and 
                    setting. <sup>12</sup> Swimming was another sport I explored, and I even mastered the backstroke and floating, which I found surprisingly relaxing.  <sup>13</sup>
                    Sports not only kept me active but also taught me discipline, teamwork, and perseverance. <sup>14</sup>
                    
                    Aside from sports, I also became skilled in gaming. <sup>15</sup> It taught me quick reflexes, decision-making, communication, strategic thinking, 
                    and teamwork. <sup>16</sup> I spent hours playing, sometimes sacrificing sleep just to get better. <sup>17</sup> Competing against others pushed me to improve, 
                    and over time, I realized that gaming wasn’t just about entertainment—it was also about learning, adapting, and working with others. <sup>18</sup>
                    
                    One of my more unusual skills is being able to stay awake for three days straight and still manage to go to class the next day. <sup>19</sup>
                    While it's not the healthiest habit, it's something I've learned to do when necessary. <sup>20</sup> Over time, it taught me resilience and the 
                    importance of pushing through difficult situations, even when my body is exhausted. <sup>21</sup> Although it's not something I would recommend, 
                    it's one of the ways I've learned to cope with the pressures and demands of daily life. <sup>22</sup></p>

            <div id="hobbies" class="content-box">
                <h2 align="center" style="font-family: Dejavu Serif ;">Hobbies</h2>
                <p> As a curious person, I love exploring different activities that bring me joy. <sup>1</sup> One of my favorite hobbies is playing 
                    video games, specifically on the computer. <sup>2</sup> I mostly play popular games like <i>Valorant, League of Legends, and Roblox, 
                    among others </i>. <sup>3</sup> I can grind for hours just to have fun, and that dedication has helped me develop valuable skills. <sup>4</sup>
                    I even peaked at <i>Immortal </i> in Valorant, the second-highest rank in the game. <sup>5</sup> I also enjoy reading, especially webtoons 
                    and manga. <sup>6</sup> The images help me visualize the story, making it more engaging. <sup>7</sup> I usually read when I feel the need to, 
                    especially when I'm overwhelmed, as it helps me calm down. <sup>8</sup> Another thing I love is sleeping—ironically, though, I rarely 
                    get enough of it. <sup>9</sup> No matter how much I want to rest, I often find myself staying up late, either playing games, watching 
                    shows, or simply overthinking. <sup>10</sup> Still, whenever I do get the chance to sleep in, it feels like the best thing in the world. <sup>11</sup>
                     I'm also a big fan of food—I love eating more than anything. <sup>12</sup> I enjoy dining out with friends, family, or even by myself.  <sup>13</sup>
                     Trying different restaurants excites me because I get to experience new flavors. <sup>14</sup> No matter what mood I’m in, good food 
                     always makes everything better. <sup>15</sup> I love watching movies and series, especially romance. <sup>16</sup> I enjoy romance because I’m 
                     always yearning for it, and watching it makes me happy. <sup>17</sup> I'm also a huge fan of Marvel movies—I could probably watch 
                     all of them in one sitting. <sup>18</sup> Additionally, I love watching K-dramas because I sometimes find them relatable. <sup>19</sup> At the 
                     end of the day, I find happiness in the little things—whether it’s gaming, food, or a good story, I always make the 
                     most of what I love. <sup>20</sup></p>

            <div id="interests" class="content-box">
                <h2 align="center" style="font-family: Dejavu Serif ;">Interests</h2>
                <p> I have many interests that keep me busy and curious about the world. <sup>1</sup>
                    When I was a kid, I was interested in content creation because I admired a YouTuber named <em> </em>CongTV. </em> <sup>2</sup> 
                    I even started making vlogs but never posted them because I eventually felt it was silly to do so. <sup>3</sup>
                    I was also interested in photography for one simple reason—I thought it was cool. <sup>4</sup> I even bought a DSLR 
                    camera to start capturing pictures, but I was too lazy to actually use it. <sup>5</sup> At first, I was excited to 
                    take shots and experiment with different angles, but over time, my interest faded. <sup>6</sup> I even watched YouTube 
                    tutorials on proper lighting and angles, but I never really put them into practice. <sup>7</sup> I also became interested 
                    in playing instruments. <sup>8</sup> I learned to play the guitar when I was young and even planned to buy an electric guitar. <sup>9</sup>
                    I’m not sure why I never went through with it. <sup>10</sup> The fun part is that my friends and I once planned to start a band,
                    but we were terrible at it. <sup>11</sup> At some point, I became so interested in Esports that I started playing almost 24/7. <sup>12</sup> 
                    I had been watching Esports since I was young, and it always fascinated me. <sup>13</sup> I even told my mom that I wanted to 
                    become a pro player, but she said it was a waste of time. <sup>14</sup> Up until now, I am still interested in Esports, and I 
                    still dream of going pro.<sup>15</sup> When I discovered clubbing, I found DJs incredibly cool. <sup>16</sup> I became interested in DJing, 
                    but I honestly have no idea where to start. <sup>17</sup> I even started imagining song-to-song transitions in my head—that's how 
                    badly I want to try being a DJ. <sup>18</sup> Looking back, I realize that my curiosity has led me to explore so many things, even 
                    if I didn’t stick with all of them. <sup>19</sup> And while I may not have mastered any of these interests yet, I know that one day, 
                    I’ll find the passion that truly defines me. <sup>20</sup></p>
